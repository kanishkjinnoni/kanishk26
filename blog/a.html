  <p>After partnering with multiple phone makers over the years, Google has finally produced a smartphone which is made by Google through and through. Right from the software of the phone to the design, everything is done by Google. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 powered device is easily the best Android smartphone you can buy today. It offers a very familiar design and a superb 2K display. Google has also incorporated a brilliant camera on the phone which can easily stand against the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and even the iPhone 7. If 5.5-inch is too large for you to handle, you can settle for the 5-inch Google Pixel. Specs: Display: 5.5-inch, 1440p SoC: Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM: 4GB Storage: 32/128GB Camera: 12.3MP, 8MP Battery: 3450mAh OS: Android 7.1</p>

    <p> Samsung was the first company to bring its 2016 flagship smartphone to India. Samsung's latest Android phone offers an updated specification sheet, and refines the whole glass and metal design introduced with the Galaxy S6 range of Android phones in 2016. It is waterproof, and supports microSD cards of up to 200GB. Samsung has used an all new Exynos 8890 SoC on the new Galaxy S7 Edge, and there is 4GB of RAM along with 32GB of internal storage. It features an AMOLED display with 2560x1440-pixel resolution, but the screen size has been increased from 5.1 inches to 5.5 inches. This has allowed Samsung to increase the battery size from 2600mAh to 3600mAh, which allows it to offer better battery life. The biggest change in the phone, though, is the new 12MP Dual Pixel camera, which shoots amazing photographs even in low light. All of these combine to make the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge the best Android phone to buy in India today. Specs: Display: 5.5-inch, 1440p SoC: Exynos 8890 RAM: 4GB Storage: 32GB Camera: 12MP, 5MP Battery: 3600mAh OS: Android 6.0</p>
